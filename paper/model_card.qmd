# Model Card: Linear Regression Model for Grocery Affordability Analysis

## Model Details

**Model Name**: Linear Regression Model for Grocery Affordability Index in Canada 

**Version**: 1.0  

**Type**: Linear Regression  

**Developer(s)**: Built using R’s lm function, analyzing historical Canadian grocery, CPI, and wage data from multiple sources.

**Date**: December 2024  

**Input Data**:  

- Dataset:  Data on Canadian grocery prices, CPI, and average wages from 
`data/02-analysis_data/grocery_data.csv`. 
- Features: 
- `log(CPI)`: Consumer Price Index, measuring inflation.
- `log(Average_Price)`: Average price of a representative grocery basket.
- `log(Time)`: Time variable tracking temporal changes.

**Output**: Predicted changes in the Affordability Index, reflecting the relationship between wages, CPI, and grocery prices over time.

## Intended Use

The model analyzes grocery affordability trends in Canada by examining relationships between inflation (CPI), grocery prices, and average wages.

**Intended Use Cases**:  

- Quantifying affordability trends over time.
- Evaluating the relationship between wages, inflation, and grocery prices. 
- Asessing if wages can keep up with inflation demand.

**Not Suitable For**:  

- Real-time grocery price forecasting.
- Predicting affordability trends outside the studied timeframe.
- Directly analyzing individual-level wage and expenditure patterns.

## Performance Characteristics

**Evaluation Metrics**: 

- *$R^2$*: 0.78, indicating strong fit to observed data. 
- *$\mbox{RMSE}$*: 0.02, reflecting the model’s accuracy in predicting Affordability Index trends.

**Key Observations**:

- Positive Relationship: log(CPI) coefficient (0.397) shows inflation correlates with slight affordability improvements, likely due to wage adjustments.
- Negative Relationship: log(Average_Price) coefficient (-0.685) demonstrates a strong negative impact of rising grocery prices on affordability.
- Gradual Improvement: log(Time) coefficient (0.024) indicates marginal improvements in affordability over time.

## Considerations for Bias and Fairness

**Potential Biases**:  

- Data reflects national averages and may not account for geographic or income-level differences.
- Data only includes a selection of groceries that may not fully caputre CPI changes.
- Data collection excludes certain population groups, such as residents in non-private dwellings or on reserves.

**Fairness**:  

- Model does not account for regional disparities or varying household compositions, which may affect affordability differently.
- Data collection excludes certain population groups, such as residents in non-private dwellings or on reserves.

---

## Limitations

1. **Scope of Data**: Focused only on grocery prices and wages; other cost-of-living factors are excluded.
2. **Short Timeframe**: Main analysis is limited to 2017–2023, which may not capture long-term trends.
3. **Linear Assumptions**: The model does not account for non-linear relationships or interactions between features.

---

## Ethical Considerations

**Transparency**:  

- Inputs, transformations, and assumptions are explicitly documented in the methodology.
- Predictions are unitless and generalized for ease of interpretation. 

**Responsibility**: 

- This model is designed for exploratory analysis and is not intended for decision-making purposes, such as wage policies or grocery pricing.

## Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Data Diversification**: Expand datasets to include regional and income-level breakdowns for comprehensive analysis.
2. **Feature Consideration**: Incorporate additional cost-of-living variables, such as housing or utilities.
3. **Model Improvements**: Explore non-linear models to better capture complex interactions between variables.

## Model Context

This linear regression model was built using the R programming language and the `lm` function. It explores how grocery affordability in Canada is influenced by inflation (CPI), grocery prices, and wages. It highlights the challenges posed by grocery-specific inflation outpacing wage growth, providing insights into affordability trends over time.
